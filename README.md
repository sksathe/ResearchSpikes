## 🧩 What Are R&D Spikes?

**R&D Spikes** are focused, time-boxed experiments used to explore:
- A **technical unknown** (e.g., testing a new open-source AI framework or building a prototype using RAG and LangChain)
- A **business unknown** (e.g., researching a GTM strategy or interviewing users to validate a new product concept)
- A **design or operational hypothesis** (e.g., testing a new workflow pattern or digital twin model)

Each spike has:
- 🎯 **Purpose / Hypothesis**  
- 🔬 **Experiment / Research Method**  
- 📊 **Outcomes & Learnings**  
- 🧠 **References & Related Assets**

---

## 🧑‍🎓 Who Can Participate?

We welcome contributions from:
- **Engineering Interns** (CS, Data Science, AI, Cloud, DevOps, etc.)
- **MBA / Business Interns** (Strategy, Marketing, Finance, Innovation)
- **Founders-in-Residence** working with TheoremLabs or its clients

Whether you’re exploring **AI frameworks, building new digital products, or testing GTM ideas**, there’s a spike for you.

## 🧠 Examples of R&D Spikes

### 🧬 Technical Spikes
- Evaluate **LangChain vs. LlamaIndex** for RAG-based enterprise bots.  
- Build an **AI Voice Agent prototype** using **ElevenLabs + OpenAI API**.  
- Benchmark **Synthetic Data frameworks** for PII-safe AI use cases.  
- Test **multi-agent orchestration** for workflow automation.  
- Evaluate **AWS Bedrock vs Azure AI Studio** for GenAI app deployment.

### 💡 Non-Technical / Business Spikes
- Design **GTM strategy** for an AI Accelerator (e.g., *PromptLine* or *SyntheticEdge*).  
- Research **market size** and competitive landscape for data products.  
- Conduct **customer interviews** to validate a product hypothesis.  
- Model **business cases** for automation-led cost reduction.  
- Evaluate **pricing models** for “AI-Lab-as-a-Service” offerings.

## 🧭 Guiding Principles

* **Curiosity First**: Don’t aim to ship a product — aim to *learn faster*.
* **Transparency**: Document openly; every failure is data.
* **Collaboration over Competition**: Pair with others; cross-pollinate ideas.
* **Applied Innovation**: Always connect experiments to real-world business contexts.
